  This project aims to investigate the social impacts on college students by analyzing graduation and withdrawal rates based on gender and ethnicity in universities across the United States of America. The data used for this analysis is gathered from the US Department of Education's API, supplemented with additional research.

## With Special Focus on:
1. Graduation and Withdrawal Rates by Gender and Ethnicity
2. Faculty Demographics

Higher education plays a crucial role in shaping individuals' lives and can have far-reaching social implications. By examining graduation and withdrawal rates, we aim to shed light on the disparities and challenges faced by different gender and ethnic groups in college settings. Understanding these social impacts is essential for promoting equity and inclusivity in higher education.
